    <p class="p2"><span style="font-weight:bold">About me:</span> I am a Fast learner that loves to problem solve. I have just recently started delving into the world 
        of coding and am finding equally interesting and infuriating. When I am not in class learning how to code I am 
        probably hanging out with my daughter: Olive. She is 10 months old as of June 4th and is already climbing up the 
        walls so she keeps me pretty busy.
